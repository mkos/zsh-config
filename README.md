ZSH config
==========

This is my personal [ZSH](http://www.zsh.org/), [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) config. Started few years back, now in its own git repo.
Also contains 
* configuration files
    * `tmux.conf`
    * `gitconfig`
* scripts
    * `install.sh` - simple script that prepares my environment
