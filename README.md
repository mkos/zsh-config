ZSH config
==========

This is my personal [ZSH](http://www.zsh.org/), [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) config. Started few years back, now in its own git repo. Now it also uses [zplug](https://github.com/b4b4r07/zplug) to manage plugins.
Also contains 
* configuration files
    * `tmux.conf`
    * `gitconfig`
* local config files 
    * make symbolic links to files in `local_config` to `~/.zsh` to activate them (__soon__: use `zplug` to manage them)
* scripts
    * `install.sh` - simple script that prepares my environment
